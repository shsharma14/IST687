# Predicting-Hotel-Revenue-and-Cancellations

The aim of this project was to provide data-driven solutions using machine learning techniques to reduce cancelations for hotels located in cities and resorts and maximize revenue and profits. More cancelation leads to loss of revenue if the hotel cannot resell the room or if they have to pay for publicity of canceled rooms and resell the room at a lower price during the last minute. By predicting which bookings are likely to be canceled and by preventing these cancelations, hotels can increase their average daily rate and minimize the losses incurred after a booking is canceled.

• Utilized the CRISP-DM process to analyze hotel guests data consisting of 119,300 rows using R.

• Performed data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis using tidyverse. Selected the best features affecting the target variable, Average Daily Revenue.

• Created linear regression models to predict what factors affect the average daily revenue generated by a hotel.

• Created classification models using support vector machine and logistic regression algorithm to determine on what factors a booking is likely to be canceled.

• Performed association rules mining to find out what specific bookings are likely to be canceled by the customer.

• Based on the initial analysis and machine learning models, provided business recommendations to reduce cancelation rates and increase profits.
